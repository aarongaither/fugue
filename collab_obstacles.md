Dumping ground for thoughts on problems to solve related to having revolving referees.

## Unique Encounterable Content
With things like: spells, equipment, npcs, and items. It may be difficult to maintain global lists of what content is available. This is mostly refering to unique content, not simple swords or provisions.

### Ideas
- Index cards with hand written info. A summary village sheet may be accompanied by NPC cards, noe for each NPC that has been introduced. Could standardize base info. Any time NPC is used, notes could be taken on the back side.

## Unfinished Sessions
How to handle when a session goes long and PCs cannot return home.

### Ideas
- That session and it's characters (and maybe hex/area/dungeon) are frozen until the group can have another session. Those characters would be unavailable for play while frozen. If a particular player opts out of a session, could be referees call on how to manage the character.
