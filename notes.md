# Notes
- No skill system, backgrounds only, narrative justification allows bonus to roll
- Tumbler characters are refered to as "Prospects"
- Point Crawl instead of hexcrawl

## Tumbler
- Add Background (maybe 1d10 of entries)
- Roll on background for +1 bonus
- Roll on occupation for +1 bonus

## Favor system
Successful prayer decreases favor by 1 or resets favor if favor is already positive
Failed prayer increases favor by 1 or resets favor if favor is already negative
There should be a way to gain or lose favor as appropriate to the deity or religion

## Titles
Positive and negative titles that function like occupation or background
