# Barbarian
- **Prime Attribute:** Strength.
- **Hit Die:** D10.
- **Race:** Humans and dwarves.

### Strength Bonus
Barbarians may add their strength modifier to any melee attack with an appropriatly barbarian-ish weapon. Get your daggers out of here!

### Bullrush
Barbarians that fail a disengagement save may still take their prescribed action if they take an immediate attack from enemies in the current group. The barbarian must receive attacks equal to the number of outnumbering enemies. These combatants may be choses at random or by the GM if he's feeling vindictive (probably the latter).

### Rage
Wounded barbarians may enter a murderous state of pure aggression. If a barbarian has taken damage in a combat, as a free action the barbarian may enter rage. When in rage, the barbarian may spend stamina dice on damage rolls (up to level, not recoverable). In addition, a raging barbarian may spend stamina dice to reduce received damage (up to level, not recoverable). A barbarian exits rage when they choose an action other than Melee Attack. A barbarian may rage only once per combat.

# Magic User
___
- **Prime Attribute:** Intelligence.
- **Race:** Any except dwarves.

#### Spell Casting
A Magic-User owns a book of spells, which does not necessarily include all of the spells on the standard lists. Reading from this book, Magic-Users may cast spells. If a Magic-User finds scrolls of spells while adventuring, these spells can be added to the Magic-User’s spellbook.

#### Saving Throw Bonus 
Magic-Users gain a bonus equal to level (max 5) on all saving throw rolls against spells, including spells from magic wands and staffs.

#### Magic Item Use
Magic-Users may use magic items like wands, rods, and scrolls (not to be confused with enchanted items, like +1 sword of slaying).

#### Knowing Spells 
A beginning Magic-User’s spellbook contains as many first level spells as their intelligence bonus + 2. If your Int bonus is -2, why did you choose this class? Get lost!

#### Backstab
Assassins may spend stamina (up to level) on damage rolls when making a melee attack against an enemy that was already attacked this turn. Stamina spent this way is not recovered on a result of 1.
