# Rules in no particular order...

## Combat (or how to lose limbs and alienate players)

### Actions
* Melee Attack
* Ranged Attack
* Defend
* Prayer
* Use an item
* Flee

### Combat Things - More Specific-y
#### Melee Attack
Choose a target. Move to that group and roll your attack. This may trigger disengagement from your current group.

#### Ranged Attack
Choose a target. Roll your attack. Penalty to hit of -1 for each combatant in the group, not including your target. If you critically fail, you hit an ally at random, if possible. Missle attacks are not permitted while engaged, so this may trigger disengagement.

#### Defend
Choose a target. Before turns of initiave start, announce your defense and remove your initiative die. If your target is yourself, you gain a +4 to all defense rolls this turn. Else, you intercept attacks on behalf of your target, no bonus to defense though.  This intercept is not optional, be careful what you wish for! If multiple combatants defend your target, choose who intercepts on a per attack basis.

#### Prayer
Choose a target. Roll for your prayer. Prayers are not permitted while engaged, so this may trigger disengagement.

#### Use an Item
Choose an item on your person. Choose a target, if applicable. No special rules at the moment. Use this action to give things to other players too. If they aren't in your group, it may trigger disengagement though.

#### Flee
Ummm, really? Ok... uh... this could trigger disengagement. If successful, you've abandoned your team. Way to go champ!

##### Engagement
When engaged some actions will trigger disengagement. If successful, go about your merry turn as you intended. If unsuccessful, do nothing. Sorry Kiddo. If there are more allies in the group than enemies, then disengagement is automatic. Otherwise, you must succeed against a flat save (no attribute bonus). The increases by 1 for each enemy you are outnumbered by. No opportunity attacks or anything, just turn purgatory.

### Stamina
At that start of each combat, each character receives stamina dice equal to their stamina rating (*_where does this derive from?_*) less any exhuastion penalties. These dice may be spent on any d20 roll as a bonus. Many classes will have special abilities that will use them as an expendale resource as well. 

## Magic (Or how I stopped worrying and learned to love the utility)

### Casting
Magic cannot be cast in combat. It requires reading froma book and usually somewhere between 60 seconds and 10 minutes. Spell are automatically successfully cast, unless something specifies otherwise.

### Exhaustion
When a spell is cast it may have an exhaustion penalty. 
* A Magic-User may cast spells at their level for a penalty of 1 fatigue. 
* Spells above their level cost a penalty of the level difference times 2.
* Spells below their level _may_ have a cost of 1. Make a Int save. Reduce the DC of the save by the difference of the spell level. On a fail, 1 exhaustion.

## Equipment Breakage
Your equipment may break. This generally only applies to re-usable equipment. The rule of thumb being, if it has a quality attribute, _even of 0 value_, then it may break as described in this section. Otherwise, breaks or failures are only narratively driven.

On a natrual roll of 1 or 20 you must check if your equipment has just broken (_see below_). This breakage check triggers after you have resolved the relevant d20 that necessitated it. That means that if you score a crit while attacking, the attack still goes off, but your weapon may break after.

When your equipment breaks, it becomes useless and valueless for it's intended purpose. Though, if narratively, getting your spear broken in half just provides you with a half staff and short spear, that's the referee's judgement call. At this time there are no repair rules, but there will likely be at some point.

### Checking for Breakage
Roll 1d6. Add the quality of your equipment to the roll. If your total is 6 or greater, your weapon does not break.
